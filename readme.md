This is a updated version of Savsoft Quiz v5.0
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm planning to simplify the tool so everyone can use it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes I made:</strong>
- Added Dutch translation
- Added options to Dutch & English language template
- Rebuild login page
- Rebuild register page
- Added redirects to register process so the user won't have to navigate manually
- Beautified/reforatted most of the code so it's much easier to read
- New SQL import file - removed all unnecessary files
- Imported all external CSS code - not depended on external platforms any more
- Added CSS code for mobile users
- Restyled all buttons so the text is easier to read
- Added CSS code to render all content - text & images look much better now
- Restyled the 'add' and 'edit' question pages
- Fixed bugs
- A lot of random restyling
<br>
<br>
<strong>To do:</strong><br>
- Rewrite php code to connect to MYSQL database for php7/8 <br>
- <i>can't run above php7.0 currently</i>
